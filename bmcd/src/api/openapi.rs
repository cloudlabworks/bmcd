//! The API, described: OpenAPI 3.1 at `GET /api/bmc/openapi.json`.
//!
//! Built from `paths::ALIASES` -- the same table that registers the routes --
//! so an operation cannot be documented without existing, or exist on a path
//! without being documented. The daemon serves its own description so the
//! document always matches the board you are on, not the site you read.
//!
//! What this release describes: every operation's path, method, summary, the
//! parameters that are known, and the error shape. Response bodies are still
//! `{}`: typing them is the next step (schemas derived from the serde types
//! the handlers already return), and an untyped-but-honest response is better
//! than a typed one guessed from memory -- the day before this was written, a
//! client shipped three formatters against shapes the daemon has never sent.
