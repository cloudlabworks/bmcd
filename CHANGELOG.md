# Changelog

The BMC daemon, as built by this fork. Upstream's own history is in the git
log; this file starts where the fork diverges, at 2.3.7.

The daemon ships to a board inside a firmware release, pinned by commit, so a
version here only reaches hardware once `BMC-Firmware` bumps that pin.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **A session token the daemon had forgotten counted as a wrong password.**
  Tokens live in memory, so a restart forgets all of them, and an expired
  token is dropped from the store. A browser tab or script still sending one
  got a 401 for each request, and each 401 counted toward the peer's ban
  exactly like a wrong password. A page that fires several requests at once
  could therefore ban its own address after a BMC reboot, and the correct
  password typed from that machine was then refused with a 429. An unknown
  token is still refused with the same 401 and `Bearer` challenge, but no
  longer counts. A 64-character random token cannot be guessed, so counting
  it gave no protection. A ban that already stands still refuses tokens.

## [2.40.0] — 2026-10-15

### Changed

- **Flashing waits up to 15 s for the module's USB boot device, and names
  what is in the way when it does not appear.** It used to look at the bus
  once, a second after power-on, and give up with "Compute module's USB
  interface not found or supported". A module that enumerates slowly, or that
  fails high-speed enumeration and is retried by the kernel, was refused for
  that. It now looks every 250 ms. If nothing turns up the error says so for
  the node (numbered as users see it) and lists the other USB devices seen on
  the node's lines, root hubs excluded, with a hint that a device in the
  mini-PCIe slot of nodes 1 and 2 shares the USB pair used for flashing. On a
  board with a fanout hub a supported device on the wrong port is still
  reported as such. Found from a user report on Discord, where a Zigbee
  stick (`1a86:7523`) in node 2's slot kept an RK1 from enumerating.
- **A cancelled flash stops waiting at once, and a flash that never starts
  puts the node back.** The wait for the boot device honours the cancel
  token, so a cancel (or a client that gave up) no longer leaves a worker
  polling for up to 15 s against a restarted flash. When the device does not
  appear, the node is powered off and USB restored exactly as after any other
  failed flash, instead of staying powered in flashing mode while the error
  tells the user to retry; the original error is the one returned.

## [2.39.0] — 2026-10-15

### Added

- **A node can be flashed from an image on the SD card, by the path the card
  listing gives.** `opt=set&type=flash&node=<0..3>&sdcard=1&file=<path>` takes
  `file` as the path relative to the card that `GET /sdcard/files` returns,
  and it is confined to the card the way the listing is: an absolute path, a
  `..` that leaves the card, a symlink that points out of it, a missing file,
  a directory and an unmounted card are each refused with a 400 and a message
  saying which. It cannot be combined with `local` or a URL. Until now the
  listing offered paths that nothing could take back. `local` is unchanged
  (an absolute path, not confined, as `tpi flash --local` uses it); it is now
  documented as such, next to `sdcard`, in the OpenAPI document, which also
  describes the flash parameters for the first time. The firmware upgrade
  shares the same code and accepts `sdcard` too. A file on the card cannot
  be named under `os_upgrade/`, which an upgrade empties before it stages.
  `sha256` is now checked for `sdcard` and `local` flashes, as it is for
  uploads and URLs; before, it was accepted and ignored. `local=0` no longer
  counts as `local`, and a card file named `httpd.img` is no longer taken for
  a URL.

### Fixed

- **`skip_crc=false` skipped the CRC check.** The flag was read by whether the
  key was present, not by its value, so `skip_crc=false` and `skip_crc=0`
  turned verification off. The web interface has sent `skip_crc=false` on every
  flash since BMC-UI 3.25.0, so every node flash started from the web
  interface skipped the check. Now `skip_crc` skips only when it is present
  with an empty value or `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on` (any case), which keeps
  `tpi`'s key-only `skip_crc` working; `0`, `false`, `no`, `off` and an absent
  key verify; any other value is refused with 400 "Invalid `skip_crc` value".
  Reported by a user on Discord.

## [2.38.4] — 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- **After an upgrade the browser could keep running the old interface, and
  the page then broke: a password-change page, nodes shown as off, a failed
  upgrade flow, until the browser cache was cleared.** The daemon sent
  `index.html` with no cache instruction, so browsers guessed how long to
  keep it (a fraction of its age, hours or days) and never asked again. The
  old page then asked for script files the new firmware no longer has, and
  was answered with the web page itself instead of a script, which the
  browser refuses to run. Now `index.html` is always checked again (a cheap
  "unchanged" answer when it is), the built files under `/assets/` are kept
  for a year because their names change with their content, and a file under
  `/assets/` that does not exist answers 404 rather than the web page. Pages
  such as `/power-control` still open the interface on a reload, and the API
  is untouched. Reported by a reader on the Turing Pi Discord.

## [2.38.3] — 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A switch document with a VLAN name was refused by `validate` and by
  `PUT`, as "did not match any variant of untagged enum Proposal".** The
  same document with `names: {}` passed. Both endpoints accept either a
  preset or a whole document, and the type that says "either" is
  `#[serde(untagged)]`, which buffers the body before choosing; in the
  buffered form a map key `"50"` is a string that never becomes the `u16`
  the names table is keyed by — while a direct read of the struct converts
  it, which is why every unit test of the document passed. From the day
  names existed. Reported as
  [BMC-Firmware#59](https://github.com/excavador-turing/BMC-Firmware/issues/59)
  by a reader whose interface greyed out *Try it* and *Apply* and told him
  his board could not check a layout; reproduced on a board with the same
  document twice.

  Names are now read from their wire form — string keys, parsed here — so
  both paths agree, and a key that is not a VLAN id is refused by name
  rather than as "no variant matched". A test feeds a named document through
  `Proposal` and through the flattened `PUT` body; on the old code it fails
  with the reporter's exact message.

## [2.38.2] — 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **A firmware source that could not be reached reported nothing rather
  than a failure.** `list_remote` read the updater's stdout and ignored how
  the process ended. `tpi-selfupdate --list` printed `{"releases":[]}` and
  exited 0 when it could not reach the source, putting the real reason on
  stderr where nothing read it -- so on a board with no resolver every
  remote source came back with no candidates and no error, and the firmware
  page rendered that as "nothing new". Reported from a 2.4 board on
  2026-09-22 as "checking github for updated firmware also fails silently",
  and reproduced on board B: with an empty `/etc/resolv.conf`, four sources,
  zero candidates, zero errors, and `curl: (6) Could not resolve host` on
  the updater's stderr.

  The exit status is now read **before** the output. The updater is fixed in
  firmware v2.36.0 to exit non-zero and print nothing; this is the other
  half, so the next script that fails cheerfully cannot put the page back to
  lying. A failure with nothing on stderr now names the exit code instead of
  saying "no output", which was the only sentence the page had to show.

## [2.38.1] — 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **A static address lost its resolvers at every reboot, and `ifup br0`
  failed at every boot.** The `up` hook 2.38.0 wrote into
  `/etc/network/interfaces` carried a literal `#` -- the `# br0` tag udhcpc
  uses on resolv.conf lines -- and ifupdown-ng reads `#` anywhere on a line
  as the start of a comment. The hook was cut off mid-string, `/bin/sh`
  refused the unterminated quote, and `ifup` exited 1 for `br0`. The address
  was already on the bridge by then, so the board came up reachable, with an
  empty `/etc/resolv.conf` (a symlink into tmpfs, fresh every boot) and a
  clock that could not resolve its server. Reported from a 2.4 board on
  2026-09-22 by the reader whose report shaped 2.38.0; he had found the
  workaround of writing a regular `resolv.conf` into the overlay by hand.

  The hook now spells the hash as `\043`, which busybox printf turns back
  into `#`; the file it writes is byte-for-byte what it was meant to be, and
  udhcpc's filter still recognises the lines as its own. Measured on board
  B: the old hook fails with "unterminated quoted string", the new one
  writes the file and `ifup` exits 0.

  **Boards that 2.38.0 already wrote are repaired at the first start of this
  daemon**: a file this daemon wrote that is not what this version renders
  is rewritten (same document, corrected hook), and a static address whose
  resolvers are missing from `/etc/resolv.conf` gets them written then --
  bmcd starts after the network does, so this is exactly the moment the
  failed hook left empty. A file written by hand is never touched.

## [2.38.0] — 2026-09-21

### Added

- **The board's own address, applied then confirmed at the new address.**
  `GET/PUT /api/bmc/network/address`, `POST .../confirm`, `.../revert`,
  `.../validate`, `GET .../limits`. One document -- `{"mode":"dhcp"}` or
  `{"mode":"static","address","prefix","gateway","dns","search"}` -- the
  same shape as the switch and for the same reason: the address is how you
  reach the page you change it from. `PUT` answers **202**; the address goes
  on the bridge, a window runs (30 s by default, 10-300), and unless a
  confirmation reaches the daemon **at the new address** the previous one is
  put back and `last_revert` says why. A confirmation from the board itself
  never used the address and is refused with 403. Only a confirmed document
  is written to `/etc/network/interfaces` -- the same v2.1 stanza the image
  ships and `S00dsa` migrates, so the boot path needs nothing new.

  **The bridge is never brought down.** `ifdown br0` would take the compute
  modules' ports out of the bridge with it; the address is changed with `ip`
  on a bridge that stays up, and udhcpc is stopped (it releases and flushes
  on SIGTERM, which is what `-R` is for) or started the way `ifup` starts it.
  The resolvers for a static address go into `/etc/resolv.conf` at apply, and
  as an `up` hook in the stanza at boot -- this image has no resolvconf.

  The board refuses what could never be reached: a gateway off the subnet,
  the network or broadcast address, a prefix outside /8-/30. It warns, and
  applies, what is merely unwise: no gateway, no resolver (so `pool.ntp.org`
  never resolves). `GET` reports `running`, `configured` (what a reboot comes
  back to), `live` (what the bridge actually has), and whether the file was
  written by this daemon, by hand, or could not be read.

  Asked for from the Discord on 2026-09-21 by a user who had set up the Split
  layout and then had to change the BMC's address over SSH.

- **`GET ?type=ntp` says what chrony thinks of each source.** `sources`: one
  entry per source from `chronyc -c sources` -- `selected`, `combined`,
  `excluded`, `unreachable`, `falseticker` or `too_variable`, stratum, how
  many of the last eight polls answered, the last offset, and whether it is
  one of the servers configured through this daemon. Every field is chrony's
  own column. "Not synchronised" alone sent a user to Discord with nothing
  to act on; chrony always knows why.

## [v2.37.0] — 2026-09-20

### Security

- **A board still on its factory password can do exactly one thing.** Every
  board leaves the factory as `root` / `turing` — printed in the quick-start
  guide, identical on every board ever sold, on a project whose own front page
  says a board should not face the internet. Upstream has had an issue open
  about it since 2023.

  Until it is changed, `/api/bmc` answers **403 to everything** except
  `/authenticate`, `/access` and `/access/password`, with a
  `application/problem+json` body saying why. Not a banner: a banner is a
  thing people close.

  **The test is the factory password, not the first login.** `root`'s hash is
  asked whether it still verifies the word `turing`, of `/etc/shadow` itself,
  cached against that file's modification time. Never a flag. A board whose
  password was changed over SSH before anyone opened the interface is never
  asked; a board reset to factory defaults is asked again, because it is a
  factory board again. A change made by anything — this daemon, `passwd`, an
  editor — is noticed on the next request, with no restart.

  **Loopback is exempt, because refusing it would protect nothing.** Anyone
  with a shell on the board is already root on it — they can read
  `/etc/shadow`, run `chpasswd`, or stop the daemon. The threat this gate
  exists for is a stranger who can reach port 443 on the management LAN, and
  that stranger is not on loopback. What the exemption buys is the on-board
  `tpi` working on a board that has not been set up; it is the only thing left
  that relies on the bypass at all. `tpi` pointed at a factory board from
  another machine is over the network, is gated, and says so.

  *(An earlier draft of this entry justified the exemption by the first-boot
  promotion check. That was wrong: `/metrics` is a separate plain-HTTP
  listener and `S99postupdate` does not pass through `/api/bmc` at all.
  Corrected rather than deleted — a security exemption with a reason that does
  not hold is worse than one with a thin reason.)*

  A wrong password on a factory board is still answered as a wrong password.
  Saying "this board is on its factory password" to a failed login would
  confirm the account name to somebody guessing.

  The fleet is gated too: a gateway vouching for a person says nothing about
  whether the board has been set up.

  `GET /api/bmc/access` gains **`factory_password`**, so the interface can
  decide what to render before it asks for anything else. An interface that
  learned its state from the 403s it collected would show a broken page first
  and the explanation second.

- **A confirmation sent from the board itself is refused.** `POST
  /api/bmc/network/switch/confirm` answers **403** to a request that arrived
  over loopback, and says why:

  > A confirmation has to arrive over the network you just changed; that is
  > what it proves. This one came from the board itself, which proves
  > nothing. Confirm from the interface, or from `tpi` on another machine.

  The whole design of apply-then-confirm rests on where the confirmation came
  from: after an apply the old path no longer exists, so a request that
  reaches the daemon came through the new configuration. A request over
  loopback crossed no switch port. It proves nothing, and it made the change
  permanent anyway — which is to say the one protection against locking
  yourself out had a hole in it that could be walked through by accident,
  from a console, by somebody being careful.

  Found on hardware, not by reading. On 2026-09-20 a document reasoned to be
  equivalent to Flat was applied to bmc-2 and confirmed from the board's own
  ssh session; the board's owner lost the interface, and the window that
  exists for exactly that case never ran, because the confirmation had
  already arrived.

  Apply and revert stay open to loopback. Applying is how a board is recovered
  from its console, and reverting is the safe direction — it puts back a
  configuration that was proved once already. Only the step that makes a
  change permanent has to have come from somewhere.

### Added

- **VLANs can be given names.** An optional `names` map on the switch
  document, VLAN id to a word of up to 32 characters, carried and persisted
  with the rest of it.

  It reaches the hardware nowhere: two documents differing only in their names
  plan no commands at all. It exists because a table of numbers is not a
  layout anybody can read a year later, and because the alternative — a name
  file beside the document — is a second thing to keep in step with the first,
  which would drift the first time somebody applied a preset.

  `Trunk` names its own two VLANs `management` and `nodes`, because those are
  the numbers the operator chose and has to match on the router. `Flat` and
  `Split` name nothing: Split's identifiers never leave the board, so putting
  them on a page would be showing somebody two numbers they can do nothing
  with.

  A name is checked for being a name — not blank, not longer than 32
  characters, no control characters, and not attached to a reserved VLAN id —
  and for nothing else. Naming a VLAN nobody is in yet is allowed: people name
  a layout while they are building it.

### Added

- **Applying a switch configuration, and being able to undo it.** The rest of
  the switch work: `GET` and `PUT /api/bmc/network/switch`, and
  `POST .../confirm` and `.../revert`.

  A change is applied on approval and kept on proof. `PUT` answers **202**,
  not 200: the configuration is on the switch but it is not yours to keep yet.
  Confirm within the window, or the board puts the previous one back by
  itself and records why, so the interface can say *your change at 12:03 was
  reverted because it was not confirmed*.

  **The confirmation must arrive on a new connection, and that is the whole
  proof.** After an apply the old path no longer exists, so any authenticated
  request that reaches the daemon came through the new configuration. Nothing
  else needs checking.

  **The window does not start when the apply returns.** It starts when the
  uplink carrying the BMC's VLAN reports forwarding. Spanning tree holds a
  port in listening and learning for its own forwarding delay first — 30
  seconds by default — so a window counted from the apply would expire before
  anybody could confirm a correct Trunk change, and would revert every one of
  them. The default window is 30 seconds and may be set per apply between 10
  and 300.

  **Only a confirmed document is ever written.** A reboot in the middle of an
  unconfirmed change finds the previous one in `/etc/bmcd/switch.json`,
  because the pending one was never persisted.

  **Safe mode skips applying, not reading.** Holding KEY1 at power-on puts
  `safemode` on the kernel command line, which `preinit` already reads; the
  daemon reads it the same way and leaves the switch alone. That is the last
  exit from a configuration that was reachable when it was confirmed and has
  since stopped being, because a cable moved or the router changed.

  The commands are planned as a list and then run, so the part most likely to
  be wrong — the order — is a pure function with tests. Filtering is enabled
  after the VLANs exist and disabled before they are removed, because a bridge
  filtering with no VLANs forwards nothing.


### Added

- **The switch as one document, and the rules the board refuses.** The model
  half of the most-asked feature on the public roadmap. Two read-only
  endpoints come with it: `GET /api/bmc/network/switch/presets` and
  `POST /api/bmc/network/switch/validate`.

  The configuration is **one object naming all seven ports** — four modules,
  the BMC's own port, and both uplinks — rather than a set of calls. Partial
  application is how a board strands itself: six `bridge vlan` calls where the
  fourth fails leave a switch in a state nobody designed. One document is
  applied as one operation, and rollback is then "apply the previous
  document".

  Three presets. **Flat** is one bridge with filtering off, how a board ships
  and the reset target. **Split** is two groups that never meet, the BMC out
  of one uplink and the modules out of the other, with nothing tagged, so the
  other end needs no VLAN configuration at all. **Trunk** is one cable
  carrying both, tagged, with the second uplink redundant under spanning tree
  by default.

  **The board expands its own presets.** A client that expanded `Split` itself
  would eventually disagree with the board about what `Split` means, and that
  disagreement shows up as a board nobody can reach.

  Five refusals, each one a lockout rather than a preference:

  - the BMC's own port in no untagged VLAN
  - the BMC's own port alone in its VLAN
  - a BMC VLAN that no uplink carries, so the board answers only to the
    modules it is meant to administer
  - a tagged BMC port, which its network stack cannot read
  - two uplinks sharing a VLAN with spanning tree off, which is a loop

  Everything else is a warning with the port it is about, so an interface can
  say what is odd without refusing it.

  Nothing here applies anything to hardware. The apply, the confirm window and
  persistence are separate and deliberately cannot be reached from this model.


### Fixed

- **A certificate naming the board by its real DNS name is no longer
  refused.** The name check compared the certificate against the board's own
  idea of what it is called, which on a real board is not what its certificate
  says.

  Found on bmc-2 while running the install gate. The board knows itself as
  `bmc-2`. Its DHCP search domain is `haarlem.internal`. The certificate its
  own authority issued names `bmc-2.haarlem.lan`. Three different answers to
  "what is this board called", none of them wrong, and only one of them
  written anywhere the board can read. That certificate was accepted only
  because it happens to carry an IP address as well.

  A certificate naming just an FQDN — which is what `step ca certificate
  bmc.lan` produces, and what the people who asked for this feature will have
  — would have been refused.

  So the check now also asks the question a browser actually asks. A browser
  does not compare a certificate against the board's idea of its own name; it
  compares it against the name the operator typed, having resolved that name
  to the board. A name that resolves to one of this board's addresses is a
  name someone can reach it by.

  Bounded at two seconds per name, and failure is simply "no match", so a
  board whose DNS is down behaves exactly as it did before. Wildcards and
  address literals are never looked up.


### Security

- **The password validator no longer logs a hash of what was typed.** It
  logged `crypt(password, hash)` at debug level on every attempt. For a
  correct password that is the stored hash, which is only as secret as
  `/etc/shadow`. For a wrong one it is a hash of whatever was typed — and what
  people type into the wrong login box is usually a password that is correct
  somewhere else. A log file is far easier to read than `/etc/shadow`, and the
  board's logs are collected.

  It was scaffolding for a four-line function that has tests.


### Added

- **Install your own certificate and key, from the interface or the API.**
  `GET`, `PUT` and `DELETE` on `/api/bmc/tls/certificate`. For anyone running
  their own CA — the request came twice from people running step-ca — who
  wants a board that a browser trusting that CA opens without a warning, and
  a serial console that works, since a click-through exception does not cover
  the console's WebSocket.

  Before this the only way to put such a certificate on a board was to copy
  two files over SSH.

  Everything is checked before anything is written, because a board given a
  certificate it cannot serve may be a board nobody can reach to correct it.
  The key must belong to the certificate; the certificate must be valid now;
  it must permit server authentication, where it says anything about purpose
  at all; and it must name this board. A certificate naming some other host is
  refused with both name lists in the reason, rather than installed for a
  browser to reject later.

  The key travels in a JSON body on its own path, never a query string. The
  legacy dispatcher writes every `opt=set` call to the audit log in full, so a
  key routed through it would be recorded in clear. What is logged is the
  action, the actor, the subject and the expiry.

  `DELETE` removes the pair and has the board issue its own, so it is never
  left without one.

### Changed

- **The certificate is no longer fixed at startup.** It lives behind a lock
  and is chosen per connection through OpenSSL's servername callback, so
  installing one takes effect on the next connection with no restart — and
  the session that sent it survives to read the answer.

  The callback is SNI's, and a BMC is normally reached by address, which sends
  no SNI. OpenSSL runs the callback for those handshakes too, and there is a
  test that connects with server-name indication switched off and asserts it
  is served the certificate installed a moment earlier. Without that, every
  board would keep serving its startup certificate while the API reported the
  new one.

- **`bmcd_tls_certificate_info` gains a `source` label**, `self-signed` or
  `installed`, read from the issuer rather than from any record of how the
  file was written. It decides whether the board renews the certificate on its
  own, so an expiry alert means something different for each.

## [2.36.3] — 2026-09-12

### Added

- **`/metrics` now reports the USB multiplexer, including which module is
  armed for USB boot.** Two families: `bmcd_node_usb_boot_armed`, one sample
  per module, and `bmcd_usb_config`, which names the node, mode, route and bus
  type of the persisted configuration.

  `tpi flash` and `tpi advanced msd` leave the configuration at
  `Flashing(NodeN, …)`. The daemon persists that and re-applies it on every
  start, which asserts that module's USB-boot pin and stops it booting from
  its own eMMC. The module keeps running, because it is already booted — so
  the fault appears at its **next** reboot, possibly weeks later, and then it
  comes up in the USB loader instead of its operating system.

  From outside, that module is indistinguishable from dead hardware: nothing
  at all on the serial console, not even a bootloader banner, because the
  loader does not use the console; nothing on the network; and the BMC
  reporting its rail on. `tpi usb status` could not separate the two either,
  because it prints the same route for `UsbA` and `Flashing`. The only readout
  that named the mode was a line in the daemon's own log.

  Measured on hive-6, 2026-09-12: twenty minutes spent on a module that looked
  dead, with the fact that explained it sitting unexported in the daemon's
  database. `bmcd_node_usb_boot_armed{node="node2"} 1` would have answered it
  in one query, and a rule on fifteen minutes of it pages the operator who
  armed it while they still remember doing so.

  The armed family is four samples rather than one because a single
  "which node" gauge cannot express *none*, and none is the normal state it
  exists to assert.

### Changed

- `UsbConfig::parts()` is now the single mapping from a stored configuration
  to `(node, mode, route)`. The `type=usb` response and the metrics exposition
  share it, so a board cannot report one thing through the API and another on
  a dashboard.

## [2.36.2] — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **The board refused every attempt to resume a TLS session, fatally.** This
  is the intermittent fleet console failure: a serial console or an API call
  through the gateway would occasionally fail outright, on both boards,
  with nothing in the daemon's log and the board perfectly healthy either
  side of it.

  Envoy keeps one TLS session per upstream cluster and offers it on the next
  connection it opens. Measured on the gateway, a third of all new upstream
  connections to the two boards died this way — 8 of 28 to one, 19 of 45 to
  the other — while every connection taken from the pool was fine, which is
  what made it look random from a browser. Reproduced deterministically from
  a pod on the gateway's own node: 30 fresh connections all succeeded, and 30
  that offered back a saved session all failed with `tlsv1 alert internal
  error`.

  OpenSSL will not resume a session on a server that asks for client
  certificates unless the context carries a session id context, and the
  refusal is not a quiet cache miss — it is `internal_error`, fatal, sent
  before a byte of HTTP is exchanged. The error, `ssl_get_prev_session:
  session id context uninitialized`, is raised on the server, which never
  logged it; the client sees only an alert it cannot explain.

  So the fault arrived with client certificates in 2.30.0 and was invisible
  from the daemon's side for six releases.

  The acceptor now sets a session id context, derived from the client CA so
  that a board whose trust anchor is replaced will not resume a session
  authenticated under the old one. There is a test that performs two real
  handshakes against the real acceptor and offers the first session back; it
  fails on 2.36.1 with the OpenSSL error above.

## [2.36.1] — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **Every refusal from the new access endpoints answered 500.** Measured on
  bmc-2 within the hour of flashing v2.28.0: "the current password is wrong"
  and "the new password is too short" both came back `500 Internal Server
  Error`, which tells a client the board is broken rather than that the
  request was — and 500 is the canonical retryable status, so a client is
  being invited to retry an answer that will never change.

  `impl ResponseError for LegacyResponse {}` was empty, so actix's default
  status applied to everything. That was invisible until now because handlers
  reached through the legacy dispatcher come back as a `LegacyResponse`
  rendered by `Responder`, which has always honoured the carried status;
  `api::access` is the first to return one as an `Err` directly to actix.

  It now reports the status it was built with and renders through the same
  conversion the success path uses, so a refusal has one shape wherever it
  came from. The guards themselves were correct throughout — the right
  requests were refused with the right messages, with the wrong number on
  them.

## [2.36.0] — 2026-09-12

### Added

- **Who may reach this board, from the interface that asks for the password**
  (SQU-209). Both halves of this board's access control used to live only on
  its filesystem and arrive over SSH: the local password through `passwd` on a
  console, the client CA through a script in another repository. Nothing in
  the web interface could answer "who can get in", and the one interface that
  demands a password every time could not change it.

  `GET /api/bmc/access` now answers with the local account, the trust anchor
  for proxied identity if one is in effect — subject, issuer, expiry and a
  SHA-256 fingerprint to compare against the proxy's — the header an identity
  is read from and which of config/override/default chose it, and **how the
  asking request was itself authenticated**. A page can now say "you are here
  as oleg@tsarev.id, vouched for by the gateway" rather than guess.

  `POST /api/bmc/access/password` changes a local password, and
  `PUT`/`DELETE /api/bmc/access/client-ca` set and remove the trust anchor.

  **Not through the legacy dispatcher, and that is the point.** Every
  `opt=set` call is written to the audit log with its whole query string, so a
  password routed that way would be recorded in clear in `bmcd.<date>.log` and
  in remote syslog when SQU-108 lands. These take a JSON body and log the
  action and the actor, never the secret.

  The rules each exist because of a specific way this could go wrong:

  - **The current password is required, including from an operator a proxy
    vouched for.** A certificate proves the gateway trusts you; it does not
    prove you hold this board's console, and a change made without the old
    password is a lockout anyone with a live session can perform.
  - **Twelve characters, counted as characters.** A passphrase is not shorter
    because it is written in Cyrillic, and `BanPatrol` slows an online guess
    but does nothing for a stolen `/etc/shadow`.
  - **A wrong password and an account that does not exist get the same
    refusal**, so this cannot be used to enumerate accounts.
  - **`chpasswd`, with the pair on stdin.** Not a shell and not a command
    line: this daemon runs as root, and a password in `argv` is in `ps` for
    anyone on the box.
  - **A CA bundle is loaded the way the TLS acceptor will load it, before it
    is stored.** A bundle that cannot be loaded makes the daemon fail to
    *start* — which is exactly why `client_ca` was never safe to ship in a
    default `config.yaml` — so it must never reach the disk.
  - **Removing the CA is refused when the caller is authenticated by it.**
    That request ends its own session, through the proxy it is asking
    through. Do it from the board's own interface, with a password.

  **The daemon does not rewrite `config.yaml`.** That file is the operator's,
  it carries comments, and the daemon reads it with a crate that has no
  writer. So the interface owns two small files instead — the bundle itself at
  a fixed path, and a JSON sidecar for the header name — and `config.yaml`
  still wins wherever it speaks. Where it pinned a value, these endpoints
  refuse to touch it and say so.

  A consequence worth having: `client_ca` now falls back to that fixed path
  **when the file exists**, so a board whose anchor was removed comes back up
  instead of refusing to start.

## [2.35.0] — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **The board could stop checking for firmware, for ever** (SQU-201). The
  Firmware page said *checking the sources now* and never stopped, with
  **Check now** disabled beside it, and no later refresh could start. Only
  restarting the daemon cleared it. Opening the Firmware tab on a board whose
  cached listing had aged out was enough to trigger it; bmc-2 sat that way for
  three and a half hours on 2026-09-11 with `refreshing: true`, the timestamp
  frozen, and no fan-out process running at all.

  The claim that says "a refresh is running" was an `AtomicBool`, taken before
  the work and released by a `Drop` guard. That is correct for a panic and
  wrong for everything else: a task dropped before its first poll constructs
  no guard, and a blocking join that never returns never drops one.

  It is a deadline now, and a deadline cannot be lost — the claim expires
  whether or not anything is left to release it. Three things release it and
  it takes all three: the guard for a panic, a `tokio::time::timeout` around
  the fan-out for a blocking join that never returns, and the deadline for the
  case where neither of the other two exists. The dedup that stops "check now"
  turning four sources into twelve requests is kept as a compare-exchange.

  The bound is ten minutes. Not a guess at the work: the fan-out was 74–78 s
  when first measured, and on 2026-09-12 took 75–100 s on bmc-1 and about
  230 s on bmc-2. It is how long a *lost* refresh may block every future one.

### Added

- **The firmware listing survives a reboot**, at
  `/mnt/overlay/firmware-catalog.json`. Asking four sources takes between 75
  and 230 seconds and spends GitHub's unauthenticated quota of sixty an hour
  four at a time, and all of it used to be thrown away by every reboot — so
  the first person to open the Firmware page after an upgrade, the person most
  likely to be looking, paid for the lot.

  It sits beside `firmware-sources.json` and on the overlay for the same
  reason: both firmware images mount it, so it survives an A/B promotion. The
  board answers from it at once and refreshes behind that answer. The age it
  reports comes from the timestamp inside the file rather than the file's
  mtime, because what a reader needs is when the *sources* were asked, and an
  age that parses to something absurd is clamped to a day.

  **It is written only when the offering changes.** The overlay is NAND and
  UBI reports five free eraseblocks of 2040 on the reference board; a listing
  rewritten every half hour would be thousands of writes a year for bytes that
  change when somebody publishes a release. The comparison is on what the
  sources offer, not the whole record, because the timestamp moves every time.

  Only a complete answer is stored: a fan-out where one source errored is good
  enough to show, because the page renders the error, and not good enough to
  become the listing a board boots with.

## [2.34.0] — 2026-09-11

### Added

- **`opt=get&type=sdcard_files`, also `GET /api/bmc/sdcard/files`: what is on
  the microSD card** (SQU-198). Name, size, modified time, and whether each
  entry could be written to a compute module.

  `tpi flash --local` already reads an image off this card, and it is the only
  sane way to write a multi-gigabyte image to a module: the browser is not in
  the path, the bytes do not cross the network twice, and an interrupted
  upload does not mean starting over. What was missing was any way to see what
  is there — so an operator had to know the path and type it, for the most
  destructive thing this board does.

  A non-candidate is **listed, not hidden**, with the reason: a 10-byte
  `.img` says it is most likely a truncated download, and a `.tpu` says it is
  BMC firmware and belongs on the firmware page. Hiding them makes an operator
  who cannot find the file they just copied conclude the page is broken.

  The verdict is from the name and the size only. Nothing opens a file:
  deciding by content means reading the head of every entry on every listing,
  and what actually protects a flash is the checksum the operator compares.

### Security

- **Every path is confined to the card, in one function with its own tests.**
  A listing that accepts `../..` is a directory browser rooted at `/` on a
  device that can reflash four computers — and the same resolver will serve
  rename and delete later, so it is worth getting right once.

  The root and the target are both canonicalised and compared, so `a/../../etc`
  and a **symlink** pointing off the card are caught by the same rule rather
  than by a check written against the text of the request. A leading `/` is
  stripped rather than honoured. A path that does not exist answers "not
  found", never "outside", because saying "outside" for a typo tells a client
  something about the filesystem it did not earn.

## [2.33.0] — 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- **A node's USB bus number is not part of its identity, and pinning it
  refused every flash.** The port check added to stop a flash of node 2
  writing node 1 compared the whole path — bus included — against a bus
  hardcoded to 1. It is not a constant. This board pairs an OHCI and an EHCI
  controller as companions for the same physical ports, so the bus a device
  lands on is decided by its **speed**: the same hub port is `1-1.2` for a
  full-speed device and `2-1.2` for a high-speed one.

  A Rockchip in maskrom is high-speed. So every RK1 the daemon was asked to
  flash or expose as mass storage was refused with

  ```
  node 2 requested on 1-1.2; found Rockusb on 2-1.2 instead
  ```

  about a module that was entirely healthy. Found on bmc-2 on 2026-09-11 while
  trying to recover a node that would not boot.

  The comparison is now on the port chain alone, which is the part that says
  which module this is. Anything downstream that has to match a sysfs path —
  finding the block device behind a module — is handed the path of the device
  that actually answered, so it carries the bus the kernel really used rather
  than a guess.

  Two tests pin it: the same hub port resolves to the same node on either bus,
  and no two nodes share a port chain once the bus is out of the comparison.

## [2.32.0] — 2026-09-11

### Added

- **`/metrics` reports when the certificate the listener is serving expires**,
  as `bmcd_tls_certificate_expiry_timestamp_seconds`, alongside
  `bmcd_tls_certificate_info{key="ecdsa-p384"}` naming the key it is built on.

  This exists because of SQU-115: a board served a certificate that had
  expired more than a year earlier and nothing anywhere said so. A number a
  scrape can alert on is the difference between that and a calendar reminder
  somebody stops reading. The key label is the first thing anyone reaches for
  when a client refuses to negotiate.

  Both are read from the certificate the daemon actually loaded, at start, so
  `/metrics` cannot disagree with the listener about which certificate is in
  use — replacing the file without restarting is exactly when a fresh read
  would describe something that is not being served.

  A daemon that cannot make sense of the date reports **no series at all**
  rather than a zero, because a zero reads as 1970 and would fire every
  expiry rule ever written against it.

  Nothing here is secret: every byte of it is sent to each client during the
  handshake.

### Confirmed

- **Every key an operator might install is served**, over TLS 1.3 and 1.2
  alike: RSA, EC P-256, P-384 and P-521, and Ed25519. This was already true
  and is now a test that performs a real handshake per key type against the
  real acceptor, so it covers the cipher list and the signature algorithms
  rather than only PEM parsing. The estate rule is P-384, cert-manager will
  mint Ed25519 on request, and a certificate from a public CA is usually
  still RSA — a daemon quietly serving only some of those fails at renewal
  time, which is the worst moment to find out.

## [2.31.0] — 2026-09-11

### Changed

- **The daemon offers TLS 1.3, with 1.2 as the fallback.** The acceptor was
  built from Mozilla's version 4 intermediate profile, which pins the maximum
  protocol version to TLS 1.2; the board's OpenSSL is 3.5.7 and was capable of
  1.3 all along. The v5 profile is 1.2 and 1.3 together, so no client loses
  anything.

  This is not a modernisation. A TLS-1.2-only server changes what a client has
  to send: under 1.2 the client's `supported_groups` extension constrains the
  curve of the SERVER's certificate as well as the key exchange (RFC 4492
  §5.1). A client whose curve list stops at P-256 — which is Envoy's default —
  cannot use a P-384 certificate and gets `handshake_failure`. Every
  certificate in the estate this daemon runs in is P-384.

  What that looked like: a proxy holding a valid client certificate, failing
  every handshake, while the page in front of it drew perfectly and every board
  card said the board did not answer. The only trace was the proxy's own
  `ssl.connection_error` counter.

  Two tests cover it, and both were confirmed to fail without the change:
  `the_acceptor_offers_tls13_and_still_falls_back_to_tls12`, and
  `a_client_with_envoys_default_curves_can_reach_a_p384_certificate`, which
  also asserts that the same client pinned to TLS 1.2 still cannot get in — so
  the test cannot quietly stop proving anything.

## [2.30.0] — 2026-09-11

### Added

- **A proxy holding a certificate from a trusted CA can name the human it
  authenticated.** `tls.client_ca` turns it on; absent, which is what a board
  ships with, nothing changes and the header below is never read. This is the
  daemon half of SQU-136 and the reason a fleet interface can be exposed while
  a board cannot.
- `tls.identity_header`, default `x-forwarded-email`: which header names that
  human. Believed **only** on a connection that presented a certificate this
  daemon verified. Without one it is ordinary attacker-controlled input —
  anybody on the management LAN can set a header — so the certificate is what
  makes it mean anything, and the two are useless apart.

### Notes

- A certificate authorises nothing by itself. It only makes the header worth
  reading; a trusted proxy that names nobody falls through to ordinary token
  authentication, and a blank name is treated as a misconfiguration rather
  than an anonymous login.
- Client certificates are requested but not required, so a browser on the
  management LAN still reaches the login page. That is the break-glass path
  and it is deliberately untouched.
- Audited as `<user> (mtls)`, so a fleet-initiated action names the operator
  rather than the proxy.

## [2.29.0] — 2026-09-10

### Added

- **`bmcd_firmware_last_promotion_timestamp_seconds`** (SQU-141). The counter
  beside it says how often the health gate reached a verdict; this says when
  the last one was, which is what an alert on "no promotion since" and a
  Grafana annotation beside a memory graph both need. The ticket asked for
  both families and only the counter had shipped.

  **It is absent rather than wrong when it cannot be trusted.** The gate writes
  whatever busybox `date` printed, and that is the board's own clock — a BMC
  that has just come up may not have reached chrony, so the instant can be well
  before the real one. The HELP text says so. And only `UTC` is accepted:
  chrono parses `%Z` as a token and cannot apply an offset, so reading any
  other zone as UTC would publish an instant that is confidently wrong and
  looks perfectly healthy. A missing gauge is a nuisance; a plausible wrong one
  is a trap.

  Three tests. One pins the exact format the gate produces, since parsing it is
  the whole feature. One refuses a non-UTC zone. One keeps garbage absent
  rather than letting it become a 1970 timestamp that reads as a real event.

### Changed

- The fan-out doc comment said 16 s; measured twice on the board on 2026-09-09
  at **74 s and 78 s**, and once at 140 s the following day. Both figures are
  now recorded with which one no longer holds. It is not cosmetic: `tpi` 1.5.0
  was written believing a re-poll was quick.

## [2.28.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **Every read operation now describes what it answers with** (SQU-177). Ten
  handlers built their response with `json!` from several sources, so there
  was no type to derive a schema from and the document said only "not
  described here". `UNTYPED` is now empty.

  The shapes are **reconstructions, not designs**: every field is what the
  handler already sent, under the name it already used. A rename would break
  `tpi` and the web interface for no gain. Where a shape is odd the oddity is
  preserved and explained — `power`, `usb` and `sdcard` answer a one-element
  array, which is upstream's convention, and the document says so rather than
  claiming an object a client cannot index.

  Two details worth having in writing. `sdcard`'s used-bytes field is `use` on
  the wire, because that is what upstream sent, and `use` is a Rust keyword —
  so the field is renamed, and a test asserts the wire name rather than the
  Rust one. And `power` reports strings, not booleans, because a rail the
  daemon cannot read is `"Unknown"`; a boolean schema would generate a client
  that cannot represent the third case.

  Four new contract tests, in the style of the six from 2.25.0. Proven by
  removing the `use` rename: the fixture fails saying it no longer exercises
  what it was written for.

### Fixed

- **A caller's mistake answers 400, not 500** (was SQU-176). Naming a cooling
  device that does not exist, or a step above the fan's maximum, is a client
  error, and the board answered as though it had failed.

  It matters because `problem+json` exists so a generated client can branch on
  `status`, and 500 is the canonical retryable one — so a client told 500 for
  "that device does not exist" retries forever against an answer that cannot
  change.

  Decided by downcasting a typed `CoolingRequestError`, not by matching on the
  message: the message is for a person and would take the status with it the
  first time somebody reworded it. The handlers wrap with `.context(...)`, so
  the check is against the root cause, and there is a test for exactly that.

### Changed

- `schemars` derives reach eleven more types. The release binary is
  **13,024,808 bytes**, up from 12,938,240 measured at 2.26.0 — about 86 KB
  across both this release and 2.27.0's removals, which were not measured
  separately. A quarter of a percent of the rootfs.

## [2.27.0] — 2026-09-09

### Changed

- **`/metrics` moved to its own listener: port 9110, plain HTTP, no
  credential** (SQU-178). It used to sit on `:443` beside the API and the web
  interface, behind TLS and a token of its own.

  The token existed for one reason — so that a credential in a scrape config
  could not also reach `/api/bmc` and power four compute modules off. On a
  listener that serves nothing but `/metrics` there is nothing else to reach.
  The property is kept and the mechanism is a port instead of a secret, which
  is one fewer thing to mint, store, rotate and leak.

  The TLS was always scraped with verification disabled, because the board's
  certificate is expired and carries no SAN, so nothing could verify it.
  Unverified TLS is a handshake per scrape on a Cortex-A7 in exchange for
  nothing. What protects the endpoint is the network, and the listener binds
  the same `host` as the API, so restricting the daemon to a management
  address restricts both.

  `metrics_port` is a new key in `default_config.yaml`, defaulted so that a
  configuration file written for an older bmcd still parses. A request to
  `/metrics` on `:443` now answers 404.

### Removed

- **The metrics token, entirely.** `GET /api/bmc/metrics-token`,
  `POST /api/bmc/metrics-token/rotate`, the `metrics_token` operation, the
  bearer check on `/metrics`, and `/mnt/overlay/metrics-token`. Removed rather
  than left dormant: an endpoint that still exists is an endpoint someone will
  use.

- **The config export's `secrets` tier.** The metrics token was the only thing
  in it, so `secrets`, `contains_secrets` and the `secrets=1` parameter all
  described a credential that no longer exists. An empty `secrets=1` would be
  a control that lies.

  `format_version` is unchanged at 1 on purpose: an export written by an older
  board still imports, because serde ignores the `secrets` and
  `contains_secrets` it carries. A test asserts that. The token inside it is
  dropped, which is the right fate for a credential nothing takes.

### Side effect worth recording

The promotion gate no longer depends on the `/api/bmc` loopback bypass. It
used to reach through it to mint itself a token; it now makes one plain
request to 9110. The on-board `tpi` is the only remaining user of the bypass
(SQU-165).

## [2.26.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **`bmcd --openapi` prints the API document and exits** (SQU-149, towards
  step 4). It needs neither a config file nor a board, which is the point:
  the docs site has to render this spec, and until now the only place it
  existed was a running BMC. That is a chicken-and-egg problem for anybody
  deciding whether to install a release.

- **The release publishes `openapi.json`**, emitted by the binary that
  implements it and checksummed beside the source tarball. Emitted rather than
  committed, so it cannot describe a version that is not the one being
  released.

  The step refuses a document with fewer than twenty paths or five schemas. A
  generator that quietly fails produces a valid-looking file, and a
  valid-looking file is what would get published. Checked both ways before
  shipping: the real run reports `28 paths, 24 schemas` and exits 0; a stubbed
  empty document exits 1 saying so.

## [2.25.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **The published schemas are now checked against what the daemon actually
  sends** (SQU-149, step 3). A schema is derived from a type and a response is
  serialised from the same type, so the two agree only as far as `schemars`
  and `serde` agree — and they part company over exactly the attributes this
  daemon uses: `skip_serializing_if`, `rename_all`, and serde `default`s.
  Where they part, the document describes a shape the board never sends, which
  is what `tpi`'s three dead formatters were made of.

  Six tests build what a board would send and hold it against what the
  document promises. Proven by making the two disagree on purpose: adding
  `#[schemars(rename_all = "PascalCase")]` beside `PortKind`'s
  `#[serde(rename_all = "lowercase")]` fails both switch-port tests, naming the
  schema. Removing it returns 13 passed.

  The cases chosen are the ones with something to get wrong: a board with no
  promotion log, where `promotion_history` is omitted entirely rather than sent
  as null; the same board mid-update with every field present; a switch port
  whose `kind` is a renamed enum; a port the driver never probed, with every
  optional absent at once; and a fan both held and governed.

  `jsonschema` is a **dev-dependency**, so none of this reaches the board.

### Fixed

- Nothing was wrong: `schemars` handles `skip_serializing_if` and
  `rename_all` correctly today. These tests record that and stop it drifting,
  which is a different and smaller claim than fixing something.

## [2.24.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **The OpenAPI document now describes what seven operations answer with**
  (SQU-149, step 2). `/thermal`, `/health`, `/cooling`, `/network`,
  `/firmware/slots`, `/firmware/sources` and `/firmware/check` carry real
  response schemas instead of `{}`.

  The schemas are **derived from the very types the handlers serialise**, not
  written out beside them. The failure this exists to stop is a client written
  against a shape the daemon has never sent — `tpi` shipped three such
  formatters, and nobody noticed because a fourth bug stopped any of them
  running. A hand-written schema is that same failure with an extra step
  between it and the reader.

- **The operations that describe nothing are listed, not merely absent.**
  Eleven handlers assemble their answer with `json!` from several sources and
  have no single type to derive from. They are named in `UNTYPED`, their `200`
  says so in words, and a test requires every read operation to be either
  described or on that list. Proven by removing `/hostname` from it: the test
  fails naming exactly that path.

  Two more tests hold the rest together: nothing may be both described and
  declared undescribed, and every `$ref` in the document must resolve to a
  component that exists. A dangling `$ref` renders as an empty box in every
  viewer and generates a client that will not compile.

### Changed

- `schemars` is a new dependency, and it costs **186 KB** of release binary,
  measured rather than assumed: 12,747,768 bytes before, 12,938,240 after.
  About half a percent of the rootfs, against a CI gate at ninety.

  A first measurement said it was free, which was wrong: with nothing calling
  the derived impls the linker had stripped them all. The number above is from
  a build where the document actually references them.

## [2.23.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **One audit line per mutating API call** (SQU-108). Until now a `power off`
  from the web interface, from `tpi` on the board and from a token over the
  network all looked the same in the log, because none of them was recorded
  with an identity. Each now writes a line on an `audit` target naming the
  action, the node, the caller, their address and the outcome.

  Written around the dispatcher rather than in each handler, for the same
  reason the dispatcher exists: there is one table of operations and two
  spellings of it, so an endpoint added later cannot quietly miss the line.
  Reads are not logged — they are most of the traffic and none of the risk.

- **The loopback bypass is named in that line.** `/api/bmc` skips
  authentication entirely for requests from the board itself; the line for one
  says `loopback (unauthenticated)` rather than folding it in with a real
  credential. It is the entry somebody reading an audit trail would most want
  to be able to find, and it is the fault this fork already documents.

- **Audit lines go to the system log as well as the rotating file.** Both
  `/tmp` and `/var/log` are tmpfs on this board, so a line that reaches only
  the file is gone at the next boot — which is exactly the event one would be
  trying to account for. They are sent to `/dev/log` as `authpriv.info`; a
  board with no syslogd keeps the file copy and says so once on startup.

  Verified against the board's own BusyBox syslogd, which renders the datagram
  as `Sep  9 14:57:06 hive-bmc authpriv.info bmcd[4242]: …`.

### Changed

- **A bearer token now remembers who it was issued to.** The token store held
  only a last-access time, so a request authenticated by a token could not
  name its user — every audit line for every logged-in operator would have
  read the same. A unit test requires the username to come back from
  authorisation rather than merely `Ok`.

## [2.22.0] — 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- **A flash now targets the module that was asked for** (SQU-105). On a v2.5
  board all four modules sit behind one GL850 hub, so every module in maskrom
  enumerates at once — and `find_first` returned whichever answered first,
  ignoring the requested node. Its comment still said "only one node can be
  visible at any given time", which was true of v2.4's single mux. The result
  was a flash of node 2 that wrote node 1 and reported success, or
  "Several supported devices found" on a routine two-module bench.

  A device is now accepted only on the hub port that node is wired to. A
  device on any other port is refused, naming both: *"node 3 requested on
  1-1.3; found Rockusb on 1-1.1 instead"*. The whole failure mode was a
  success message, so the replacement had to be an error that says what it
  found.

  The same rule applies to the mass-storage side: `get_device_path` used to
  demand exactly one Rockchip block device on the entire board and give up
  otherwise. It now filters by port, so two modules in maskrom stop being an
  ambiguity to report and become two ports to tell apart.

- **The node-to-port mapping is read from the device tree, not assumed.** The
  v2.5 DTS declares `hub@1` with `node1@1` through `node4@4`, and the kernel
  publishes all of it under `/proc/device-tree`. Node N is port N on this
  board; hard-coding that would have been correct and would still have been a
  guess, and a wrong guess here writes the wrong module — which is the harm
  being fixed. A unit test builds a tree wired in the opposite order and
  requires the opposite answer.

  A board that describes no such hub — v2.4, one node visible at a time —
  yields no topology, and the first-match behaviour is kept unchanged. The
  device tree is therefore also the board-revision test, which is better than
  a revision string because it is the fact the kernel itself is acting on.

## [2.21.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **A fan can now be held at a step** (SQU-170). `opt=set&type=cooling` takes a
  new optional `mode`: `manual` pauses the zone's governor and then writes the
  step, `auto` hands the fan back. Omitted, the request means exactly what it
  always did — write the step and leave the governor running — so a client
  written before this keeps its behaviour.

  Until now `set_cooling_speed` wrote `cur_state` into a zone whose policy is
  `step_wise`, and the governor returned the fan to the trip the board was
  above within a poll. The write succeeded and the setting did not survive,
  which is the defect behind the fan slider that springs back.

  The governor is paused *before* the step is written. A `step_wise` poll is
  short enough to land between two writes done the other way round, which
  would leave the governor off on a step nobody asked for. If the step then
  fails to write, the governor is handed back rather than left paused.

- **`type=cooling` reports `zone` and `overridden`**, so a client can tell
  whether a step it writes will hold instead of leaving a person to watch a
  slider and guess. `zone` is read from the zone's own `cdevN` symlinks rather
  than assumed: the kernel records the binding on the zone's side only, and
  `thermal_zone0` driving `cooling_device0` is true of this board, not of the
  interface.

- **`bmcd_cooling_overridden`**, 1 while a fan is held. A hold that outlives
  the person who set it is the failure mode worth alerting on.

### Changed

- **A held fan is taken back above the zone's hottest `active` trip**, checked
  every 15 seconds. This board declares no `critical` trip — the hottest thing
  in its device tree is `hot` at 95 °C, which notifies and does not act — so
  nothing else would intervene if a fan were left on a low step while the board
  climbed. Somebody who paused the governor and walked away is not expressing a
  preference about 80 °C.

  The ceiling is the zone's own trip rather than a constant, for the same
  reason the rest of the daemon reads its trips instead of carrying a table.

- **Every paused governor is resumed at startup.** A hold lives in the kernel,
  not in this process, so one left behind by a daemon that died is still in
  force with nothing tracking it.

- **A hold is deliberately not persisted**, which is the one way it differs
  from a plain speed. A persisted speed is replayed into a board whose governor
  overrules it immediately, so the worst it can do is be briefly wrong. A
  persisted hold would come back after a reboot with nothing regulating the fan
  and nobody present who remembers asking for it.

## [2.20.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **`bmcd_process_threads`** (SQU-172). The companion to
  `bmcd_process_resident_bytes`, and the number that says *which kind* of
  growth is happening: a heap leak grows the resident set with the thread count
  flat, while a leaked task or an unreaped blocking thread grows both, because
  every thread carries a stack.

  Added because the 2026-09-09 outage could not be attributed. The board's
  memory series was queried afterwards and settles one thing: available memory
  fell about 0.95 MB a minute from 01:15 and **recovered at each daemon
  restart** (+3.4 MB, then +10.7 MB), so the memory was held by this process
  and freed when it exited. What it does not settle is whether that was the
  heap or threads. This metric answers that at a glance next time.

  Read from `/proc/self/status`, not by counting `/proc/self/task`, which would
  be a directory read per scrape on a 116 MB board.

### Changed

- **The hardware-less build starts** (SQU-117). `run_event_listener` opens
  `/dev/input/event0`, which exists only on the board, and returned an error
  `main` propagated -- so `--features stubbed`, the build whose entire purpose
  is running without a board, could not start on one. It now warns and carries
  on under that feature only. The default build, which is what the firmware
  compiles, still treats a missing input device as fatal.

  This does not make the daemon properly hardware-less. `/sys/class/thermal`
  is not stubbed at all: on a workstation it enumerates the host's cooling
  devices and reports them as the board's. See SQU-117 for the rest.


### Added

- **CI compiles for the board** (SQU-171). 2.15.0 multiplied two `statvfs`
  counts, which are `u64` on x86-64 and `u32` on this board's 32-bit ARM. Every
  CI job was green and the Buildroot cross-compile failed two hours later,
  because that build was the only thing in the estate that compiled this daemon
  for the target.

  A new `cross` job runs `cargo check` against
  `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` with an armhf sysroot, in about twenty
  seconds. Verified by reintroducing the 2.15.0 expression on a scratch tree:
  clippy stays green while the new job fails with `expected u32, found u64` at
  the comparison. That asymmetry is the whole point.

  The board is actually built **soft-float** (`BR2_ARM_EABI=y`), so its triple
  is `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabi` -- Debian's `armel`, which Ubuntu does not
  carry. The hard-float target stands in for it, and the job asserts what makes
  that safe: rustc's cfg for the two differs in `target_abi` and nothing else,
  so type layout and integer widths are identical. The assertion fails if they
  ever diverge further.


## [2.19.1] — 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- **Two strings had source indentation in the middle of a sentence.** A literal
  wrapped across source lines and joined by rustfmt keeps the leading spaces of
  the continuation. Nothing complains: it compiles, it renders, and the
  exposition stays valid Prometheus.

  One was the `# HELP` text of `bmcd_firmware_promotion_total`, which is
  published to every scraper and shown in dashboard tooltips. The other was the
  error shown when parking an image with no SD card mounted.

- **A test that covered nothing.** The guard written for the above passed with
  the defect still present: both metric fixtures leave `promotion_history` at
  `None`, so neither renders the family the test was written for. It now fills
  the optional fields, and asserts the family is in the output before checking
  it -- so the test cannot go quiet again.

## [2.19.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **A rollback can be named** (SQU-158). The interface said *"Rollback: version
  not readable"* — honest, because that volume is never mounted, and useless to
  somebody deciding whether to press Reboot.

  Only the stager ever knows: by the time the gate runs it is the *new* image
  reading `/etc/os-release`. So both stagers now write `REPLACES=` into the
  staged note, `S99postupdate` copies it to `/mnt/overlay/rollback-version` at
  the instant it promotes, and `firmware_slots` reports it as the rollback
  slot's version.

  A board with no such file still renders "not readable". The version is
  reported when it was recorded and never guessed — the same rule the rest of
  this endpoint follows.

## [2.18.0] — 2026-09-09

The board wedged at 02:11 UTC after losing roughly a megabyte a minute under
continuous polling (SQU-172). Its kernel still answered ICMP; nothing
listened. The four compute modules were untouched. Recovering it needs a
person at the rack, and the metrics could only show the *board's* memory
falling — not what was consuming it. These three changes are so the next
occurrence is diagnosable, and so one of the plausible causes cannot happen.

### Added

- **`bmcd_process_resident_bytes`**, this daemon's own resident set from
  `/proc/self/statm`. Board memory says the board is being consumed; only this
  says by whom. Its absence is why the diagnosis above had to be argued from
  timing rather than read off a graph.

### Fixed

- **The catalogue's `refreshing` flag can no longer stick.** It was cleared by
  a statement after `fan_out().await`, so a panic anywhere in the fan-out left
  it set for ever — and the interface polls every two seconds for as long as
  it is set. One browser tab left open then becomes a permanent 2-second poll
  of a board with 116 MB of RAM. It is cleared by a drop guard now, which runs
  on a panic as well as on success.

### Changed

- `FRESH_AFTER_ERROR` carries the arithmetic that makes it consequential: one
  configured source publishes no checksums and therefore errors routinely, so
  this two-minute value is the interval that actually governs, and each expiry
  spawns a shell and a `curl` per source.

## [2.17.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **`bmcd_firmware_promotion_total{result}`** (SQU-141), counted from the
  gate's own log. Its history lived only in `/mnt/overlay/postupdate.log`, so
  "nineteen consecutive clean promotions" was a number counted by hand and
  written on a website, where it went stale.

  It had also gone *wrong*: the board's own log says **fifteen boots ran the
  gate and one was refused** — fourteen promotions, not nineteen. The
  hand-counted figure had drifted, which is the entire argument for the
  metric. The site's number will link to a query instead of a claim.

  `promoted` is derived as attempts minus rollbacks, because the gate has no
  single line meaning *kept*: it can finish through the metrics check, by
  skipping that check on a board with no `curl`, or by promoting anyway when
  there is no volume to fall back to. Deriving covers all three. The one
  inaccuracy is a board cut off mid-gate, whose unfinished attempt counts as
  promoted — said plainly in the metric's help text rather than hidden.
- `firmware_slots` carries `promotion_history`, so the same counts are
  available without a scrape credential.

## [2.16.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **One path per operation** (SQU-149, step 1). `GET /api/bmc/thermal`,
  `POST /api/bmc/hostname`, and thirty-three more, each reaching **the same
  arm of the same dispatcher** as its `?opt=&type=` form — there is no second
  implementation to drift. The legacy form stays exactly as it is; it is what
  upstream's `tpi`, this fork's `tpi`, the web interface and a decade of
  scripts speak.

  What differs, and only on the new paths: a success answers with the bare
  result rather than `{"response":[{"result":…}]}`; a refusal answers with
  `application/problem+json` (RFC 9457) carrying the same message the legacy
  form puts in `result`; mutations are `POST` and take parameters as a form or
  a JSON body as well as in the query string, with the query string winning on
  a clash. `POST /firmware/sources` and `POST /config` accept the document
  itself as the JSON body — the shape a person would write — rather than only
  the escaped-string-in-a-parameter shape the legacy form needs.

- **`GET /api/bmc/openapi.json`**, OpenAPI 3.1, built from the same table that
  registers the routes, so an operation cannot be documented without existing
  or exist without being documented. This release describes every operation's
  path, method, summary, the parameters that are known, and the error shape.
  **Response bodies are still `{}`**: typing them from the serde types the
  handlers return is the next step, and an untyped-but-honest response is
  better than a typed one guessed from memory — the day before this was
  written, a client shipped three formatters against shapes this daemon has
  never sent.

### Changed

- `api_entry`'s dispatch is a function of its own, with two callers.

## [2.15.1] — 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- **Park mode did not compile for the board.** `statvfs`'s block counts are
  `u64` on x86-64 and **`u32` on this board's 32-bit ARM**, so
  `blocks_available() * fragment_size()` built on a workstation and failed to
  cross-compile — and would have overflowed at 4 GB if it had. Cast to `u64`
  before multiplying, which is what `select_staging_dir` two hundred lines
  below already does.

  Caught by the firmware build, not by `just check`. That is the point worth
  recording: **a green workstation check is not evidence the daemon builds for
  the board.** Nothing in this repository's CI cross-compiles; the firmware
  build is the only thing that does, and it is two hours long.

  The widening is a small generic rather than a cast at the call site, because
  neither `as u64` nor `u64::from` works on both: both are required for the
  target and both trip clippy on the host, where the types already match. A
  generic conversion is correct on both platforms and carries the reason with
  it, which a lint suppression would not.

## [2.15.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **`type=thermal` reports each zone's trip points** (SQU-135). The governor is
  `step_wise`, so the fan's step is a *consequence* of which trips the board
  has crossed — and "the fan is on step 4" with no reason attached is the
  question this fork was asked to investigate. Measured on the board:
  `fan_min` 20 °C, `fan_low` 45 °C, `fan_mid` 60 °C, `fan_high` 70 °C, all
  `active`, plus `hot` at 95 °C; the board reads 50.6 °C, which is above
  `fan_low`, which is step 4. Nothing mysterious, and now nothing hidden.

  Read from sysfs rather than written into a client, for the same reason the
  cooling levels are: it is a fact about *this* board. The trip type is passed
  through as the kernel spells it rather than mapped, so a client that meets an
  unfamiliar one shows it instead of swallowing it.

## [2.14.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **Config export and import** (SQU-142). `opt=get&type=config` returns
  everything a person has configured as one JSON document — hostname, time
  servers, firmware sources, node names — and `opt=set&type=config` applies
  one. Board B is a named milestone, and the first thing anyone will want is
  "make it like board A"; today that is five settings re-entered by hand plus a
  metrics token re-pasted into a scrape config.

  **An allow-list, never "everything on the overlay."** The overlay also
  carries `htoprc` and a zero-byte `crond.reboot`, residue of tools that were
  removed, and a wholesale copy would clone that junk to a board that never had
  them.

  **The token is what makes an export sensitive.** `secrets=1` includes the
  metrics token; without it the key is absent from the document entirely rather
  than present and empty. `contains_secrets` is on the document's face, because
  the difference decides how the file has to be handled and nobody will
  remember which request produced it. A token being imported is validated as
  hexadecimal — it is written into a `KEY=VALUE` file and used as a Basic-auth
  password, so a newline or a colon in it would forge a field or split a
  credential.

  **Import is deliberately not transactional.** A hostname and a set of
  firmware sources cannot be rolled back together, and reporting a partial
  apply as a failure would leave an operator unsure which half took. Every
  field reports its own outcome as applied, skipped or failed.

  **`power_on_time` is never imported.** It is when *this* board last powered a
  node on; carried to another board it would report an uptime that never
  happened.

  The network configuration is not included and will not be: it is per-board by
  definition and already has its own reset path.
- `metrics_token::peek()` reads the stored token without minting one. A backup
  must record what a board has, not create a credential as a side effect of
  being backed up — which `ensure()` would have done.

## [2.13.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **The time sources are a setting** (SQU-167). `opt=get&type=ntp` returns the
  configured servers, whether the running image can accept any, and the clock's
  state; `opt=set&type=ntp&servers=a,b` replaces them and reloads chrony live.

  The image ships `pool pool.ntp.org iburst`, so a board synchronises straight
  to the public pool with no way to change that short of an SSH session. The
  RTC covers boot, so this is not about correctness at power-on: it is about
  the one time somebody is standing at the board — a WAN outage — when chrony
  loses its only source and the clock quietly stops being disciplined.

  Written as a chrony `sourcedir` file rather than by rewriting
  `/etc/chrony.conf`: that config is in the read-only image, and
  `chronyc reload sources` picks up the change without restarting chronyd or
  losing the discipline it has built up. The first server is written with
  chrony's `prefer`, and only the first — chrony treats several preferred
  sources as equals, which is not what an ordered list means.

  Server names are validated against an allow-list before they are written,
  and that is not politeness: the lines are `server <value> iburst` in another
  daemon's config file, so a value carrying a newline would append directives
  of its own. `configurable` reports false on an image whose `chrony.conf`
  predates the `sourcedir` line, because a setting that is saved and silently
  never read is worse than one that is absent.

- **The hostname is a control** (SQU-138). `opt=get&type=hostname` returns the
  live name and the one that takes effect at the next boot — they differ when
  someone has run `hostname` by hand — and `opt=set&type=hostname&name=…`
  changes both and restarts `mdnsd` so the board stops advertising the name it
  no longer has.

  Validated as a single DNS label: letters, digits and hyphens, at most 63,
  no leading or trailing hyphen, and **no dots**. The file format would accept
  a qualified name and `mdnsd` would then advertise `a.b.local`, which is not
  what anyone meant.

  Renaming changes the `instance` label on every metrics series, so a
  Prometheus history does not follow it. That is a decision, not a side
  effect, and it belongs to whoever presses the button — the interface says so
  before it happens.

## [2.12.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **Park an uploaded image instead of installing it** (SQU-134).
  `opt=set&type=firmware&park=1` writes the image to `/mnt/sdcard/firmware/`
  and stops: nothing is staged, nothing is armed, and the catalogue's `local`
  source lists it on the next read like any other candidate.

  Until now an upload was never a thing you *had*, only a thing that
  *happened* — `os_update` stages into a scratch directory, runs `osupdate` on
  it at once, and deletes the directory. That made the browser's upload
  control a second way to install, bypassing the catalogue, so an operator
  could upload one image and install another with the interface never showing
  which.

  Three refusals, each for a measured reason. The card must be mounted:
  `/mnt/sdcard` is an empty directory when no card is in the slot, and writing
  there fills the root filesystem instead. It must have room. And the write
  goes to a `.partial` file that is renamed only once it is complete and
  synced, because a truncated image in the directory the catalogue reads would
  be offered for install.

  Parking does **not** make the already-staged refusal, and that is
  deliberate: nothing is being armed, so a board with an image already staged
  can still be given another to choose from later.

## [2.11.0] — 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- **The catalogue no longer blocks the page, or every other request with it**
  (SQU-143, the cause behind SQU-132). Measured on the board first, because the
  ticket held a hypothesis and not a diagnosis:

  | request | before |
  |---|---|
  | `firmware_available&refresh=1`, four sources | **15.9 s** |
  | the same, asking for one source | **15.7 s** |
  | cached | 0.18 s |

  Three faults, compounding. The fan-out ran the sources through a single
  `spawn_blocking` and a `.map()`, so it cost their **sum** rather than the
  slowest. The cache mutex was **held for the whole of it**, so a "check now"
  froze every other reader too — including a page that wanted nothing but the
  cached list, which is why the freeze looked like it happened on open. And
  asking for one source refreshed all four, because the refresh was never per
  source at all.

  Now: one `spawn_blocking` per source through a `JoinSet`, answers reordered
  to the configured order; the lock taken only to store the result; and a
  caller gets the cached catalogue at once with `refreshing` set while the
  refresh runs behind it. `refresh=1` starts that refresh instead of waiting
  for the entry to age out, and returns immediately.

### Added

- `Catalog.refreshing` and `Catalog.age_seconds`, so a page can draw a spinner
  on its own control and say how old the list is without parsing a timestamp
  and trusting two clocks. `refreshing` is omitted when false, so a settled
  catalogue serialises exactly as before.
- The catalogue is primed at start-up. Otherwise the first caller after a boot
  pays for the fan-out, and that is the person watching a board come back from
  a firmware update.
- A refresh already in flight is joined, not duplicated: four sources would
  otherwise become twelve requests against a GitHub quota of sixty an hour.

## [2.10.1] — 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- **A parked image is ordered against what is running** (SQU-169). A local
  candidate was reported with an `unknown` relation whatever its name, so a
  `v2.8.1-rc1` on the SD card while the board ran v2.8.0 showed as `?`, sorted
  under "older or unrelated", and `tpi firmware check` never mentioned it.
  Found while flashing the gate test image.

  The old comment argued that a file on a card carries no promise that its name
  reflects its contents. True — and that is what the `trust` column says, which
  already reads `unverified` for every local file. Declining to order as well
  told the user the same thing twice and hid a real upgrade. Version-shaped
  names are now ordered; anything else still declines.
- Local candidates are listed newest first by that same ordering. A lexical
  sort put `v2.9.0` above `v2.10.0` in a list whose own `relation` fields said
  the opposite.
- `prerelease` is set from the tag rather than hard-coded to `false`, so a
  candidate can be labelled as one.

### Added

- `app::version`, an ordering for release tags, with the two rules this fork
  has already got wrong somewhere: numbers compare as numbers (`2.10.0` is
  after `2.9.0`, which a text compare reverses), and a prerelease comes before
  its own release (`v2.8.1-rc1` is after `v2.8.0` and before `v2.8.1`).
  Anything not version-shaped compares to nothing at all, because a build
  stamped `VERSION=local` once sorted first and made every release on the list
  look like an upgrade.

## [2.10.0] — 2026-09-08

### Changed

- Rust 1.98.1 across the workspace, dependencies refreshed, and 23 clippy lints
  fixed rather than suppressed. `NodeType`, `DummyValidator` and
  `FalseValidator` deleted as unused; an `unreachable!()` in `utils` replaced by
  `as_chunks::<2>()`, which makes the case impossible instead of asserting it.

## [2.9.0] — 2026-09-08

### Changed

- Firmware sources point at `excavador-turing/BMC-Firmware`. A board that still
  holds a retired location is migrated on load and the result persisted, so the
  move needs no action on the board.

## [2.8.0] — 2026-09-08

### Added

- Firmware sources are configurable and catalogued: GitHub releases, an HTTP
  directory, or the SD card, each candidate reported with how it compares to
  the running version and how much is known about its integrity.
- `firmware_install`, so a chosen version can be staged.

## [2.7.0] — 2026-09-07

### Added

- `/metrics` authenticates with its own token rather than the root password, so
  a scrape credential cannot touch `/api/bmc`.
- The daemon reports whether a newer firmware release exists.

### Changed

- Every switch metric series carries `kind`, not only the ones that are present.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-09-07

### Added

- `firmware_info` reports *which* image is staged, not merely that one is.
- The kernel release is reported on the About page.
- A release is published when a version tag is pushed.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-09-06

### Added

- A Prometheus scrape endpoint, behind authentication.
- The SoC temperature and the cooling state, the fan's real duty from the
  device tree, the running firmware slot and what a rollback lands on, and the
  condition of the BMC itself.
- A browser can authenticate the serial websocket.

### Fixed

- `/info` is no longer served unauthenticated over plain HTTP (SQU-125).
- A ban answers with 429 and a `Retry-After` rather than "wrong password".
- Only `http/1.1` is offered over ALPN, so h2 framing is unreachable (SQU-126).
