# What CI runs, runnable here.

# Every recipe below is the exact command from .github/workflows/cargo_ci.yml.
# That is the point: a recipe that only approximates CI tells you nothing when
# it passes. If CI changes, these change with it.
#
# The toolchain is pinned to 1.98.1 in rust-toolchain.toml, the same version
# that workflow installs and the firmware builds with. It is pinned because
# clippy gains lints every release and `-D warnings` would turn this red
# without anyone touching the code. devbox.json installs rustup, which reads
# the pin.

# The `stubbed` feature swaps the GPIO/sysfs HAL for an in-memory simulation and
# is the only way to build this daemon without a Turing Pi under it. It had not
# compiled since before v2.3.7 because nothing built it, so it drifted out of
# sync with the HAL it stands in for and nobody found out. These two are what
# stop that happening again.

# Lints against the hardware-less HAL
